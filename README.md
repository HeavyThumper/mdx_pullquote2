##PullQuote Extension for Python-Markdown

Adds generation of Pull Quotes to Python-Markdown. Pull Quotes are
text that should be highlighted within a paragraph. This extension
copies the delimited text into a span that appears prior to the
enclosing paragraph - CSS makes the rest of the magic happen for
positioning.

This is not only my first Python-Markdown extension - it's my first
time working with Python, period. So it took a bit to get things
to where they seem to work right - and I left a bunch of comments to
help me if I need to tweak it. So there's probably some perfectly
obvious items here - but I prefer overcommenting to puzzles.

On the other hand, I'd love to hear about more elegant/efficient
methods to accomplish the same processing. By all means please
play with this as you will.

If you make use of this, I'd appreciate hearing about it. Just so
I know I'm not the only one trying to do this stuff.
