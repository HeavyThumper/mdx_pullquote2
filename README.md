##PullQuote Extension for Python-Markdown

Adds generation of Pull Quotes to Python-Markdown. Pull Quotes are
text that should be highlighted within a paragraph. This extension
copies the delimited text into a span that appears prior to the
enclosing paragraph - CSS makes the rest of the magic happen for
positioning.
